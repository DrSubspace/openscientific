## About OpenScientific

Science belongs to everyone.

**OpenScientific** exists to keep the world informed and inspired through free, open, and accessible science communication.  
We translate new discoveries into clear stories — free from paywalls, jargon, or hype — because knowledge should empower, not exclude.

We cover discoveries across physics, astronomy, biology, AI, and more, focusing on how each piece of research fits into the bigger picture of human knowledge. Every article is written to be concise, sourced, and accessible to both scientists and the scientifically curious.

### Our Mission
To make science open, transparent, and inspiring for everyone.  
We believe knowledge should be shared freely — not hidden behind paywalls.

### The Vision
OpenScientific is growing into a larger platform for **open-access research**, **collaboration**, and **scientific publishing**.  
Our long-term goal is to give every researcher a place to publish their work publicly, without cost or gatekeeping — so that science can progress faster and stay open to the world.
